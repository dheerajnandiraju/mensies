- Reproductive health
- Period tracking
- Hormonal issues linked to menstruation (e.g., hormonal regulation, hormones involved in the menstrual cycle)
- Menstrual hygiene
- Medical concerns around menstruation
- Queries in regional languages written in English (e.g., Telugu, Hindi)

REJECT queries that are:
- About unrelated topics like programming, devices, travel
- General health questions not tied to menstruation
- Vague or off-topic
